## DC OPF using FICO software

The optimal power flow get the minimum cost of the system with the following contraints:
+ Supply must meet demand
+ Generator limits
+ Considers power flows
+ Considers the power flow limits of lines
+ Only active power
+ No losses
+ Assumes no resistance of lines
+ V = 1 p.u in busbars
